Developer Workflow

- Regular code changes done on local machines
- push to github and openshift
- any django related admin changes done in /var/lib/openshift/5329027be0b8cdba4e00000b/app-root/data/soapbox (local openshift repo) on openshift server (has a copy of the openshift repo...make sure you pull before doing anything this repo may not be up to date)

Overall 4 Separate Repos :

1. Local Git Repo - All code changes done here
2. Github Repo - Basically a backup of all the code
3. Openshift Remote Repo - Deployed code
4. Openshift Local Repo - For using manage.py and other django administration changes (dont make code changes here) 
	4a. If there is a repo change here, run `git push` - this will push to openshift server.
	4b. Then go to local machine, do a 'git pull openshift <local_branch>' to pick up those changes
	4c. Then do whatever editing and remember to eventually do a 'git push' to update GitHub
